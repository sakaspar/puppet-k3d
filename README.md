This sets up a basic Flux and Kustomize deployment for the repository, with a GitRepository that watches the repository for changes to the k8s/ directory, and applies the Kustomization resources in that directory.

The cluster.yaml file sets up a basic Kubernetes cluster with a single node, and the Prometheus configuration sets up Prometheus with a single replica using the ServiceMonitorSelector to select the ServiceMonitor resources in the same directory.

The Puppet code sets up K3d with a single node cluster, a local registry, and deploys Prometheus using the K3d resources.

The Flux and Kustomize configuration sets up a GitRepository that watches the repository for changes to the k8s/ directory, and applies the Kustomizations in that directory.

The base Kustomization file includes the common resources for the cluster, such as the Namespace, ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding, Deployment, and Service resources.

To set up the repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:
git clone [https://github.com/username/repo.git](https://github.com/sakaspar/puppet-k3d)

2. Install Puppet and any dependencies:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install puppet-agent

3. Install Flux and Kustomize:
flux install --git-user=username --git-email=email --git-url=https://github.com/sakaspar/puppet-k3d.
